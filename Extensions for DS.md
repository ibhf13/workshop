# Extensions for DataScience
Extenstions are add-ons that help to improve the workflow and productivity of developers while working on DataScience projects. Here are some popular extensions:

## Python 
Python is the go to language in DataScience and DataAnalytics. It is easy to get the code running and is really versatile in what can be done with this language. This is a package, which comes with some additional features that are also useful.

## Jupyter
Jupyter Notebook is a tool, that helps structuring your code and can be used for experiments. Most projects in DataScience start in a JupyterNotebook and are later transformed into plain python files. Working as a team in a single Jupyter file is not recommended.
